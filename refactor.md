Fullstack Next.JS refactor

1. Switch to a new branch (next-js)
2. Refactor the entire Vite codebase to use next-js (instead of separate client a server directories, have a main src directory with next js app router stuff)
3. Port the front and backend over, organize everything to represent best coding practices (e.g. SSR, reusable code, consistent coloring and styling)
4. Keep the overall website design as similar as possible
5. Ensure everything works with the existing Algorithms/Simulation (front and backend), the Algos/Simulation engines are already running on their respective ports defined in client/.env
