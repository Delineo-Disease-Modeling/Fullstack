Delineo website developed & ported to [React.JS](https://github.com/facebook/react).

Try it out: <https://delineo.me>

## Setup

You'll need to install [node](https://nodejs.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) first.

You want to install and run the Delineo [Simulator](https://github.com/Delineo-Disease-Modeling/Simulation) and [Database](https://github.com/Delineo-Disease-Modeling/Database) next.

Then, clone this repository locally and navigate to the `client` folder and create a `.env` file with the following schema:

```text
# Simulator server IP
VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1880/

# Database server IP 
VITE_DB_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1890/

# If set to true, will use data from disk
VITE_USE_CACHED_DATA=FALSE
```

Then, while still in the `client` folder, run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
